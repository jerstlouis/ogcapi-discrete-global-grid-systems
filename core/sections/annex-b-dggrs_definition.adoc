== Discrete Global Grid Reference System Definitions

The following informative schema describes the expected response of the resource linked to by using the `[ogc-rel:dggrs-definition]` link relation
from the DGGRS description. This behavior is specified by the <<rc_core,Core requirements class>>.
An important objective for this schema is to support establishing authoritative registries of DGGRSs providing a URI for a DGGRS corresponding to a specific definition.

Note that this schema is preliminary, and a normative version may be defined in a later version of the OGC API - DGGS Standard
or by a future part of OGC Abstract Specification Topic 21.
The schema may change to support a better description of existing and new classes of DGGH.

The DGGRS definition consists of three main components:

* The definition of the hierarchy of discrete global grids (`dggh`), including any parameterization such as the spheroid or orientation, establishing both the topology as well as the geometry of every zone,
* The Zonal Identifier Reference System (`zirs`), with textual identifiers being mandatory while 64-bit integer identifiers (which support the <<rc_zone-uint64,64-bit integer zone list encoding requirements class>>) are optional,
* The sub-zone ordering (`subZoneOrder`), which allows for <<rc_data-retrieval,retrieving zone data>> using e.g., <<rc_data-json,DGGS-JSON>> at a <<rc_data-custom-depths,`zone-depth`>> other than 0 (the values of sub-zones can be provided as a 1D array of values with a pre-established association to sub-zones).

Whereas the ZIRS provides a mechanism to globally identify a single zone using a textual identifier (and alternatively using a 64-bit integer), the deterministic sub-zone order provides
a local indexing mechanism to address smaller regions within a particular zone. This local indexing mechanism enables the DGGS-optimized data encodings defined by the DGGS-JSON and DGGS-JSON-FG requirements classes.
The two mechanisms may potentially be related to each other, for example using the same space filling curve such as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve[Morton code (Z-order curve)], but do not need to be.
If defining a more optimal sub-zone order for a particular DGGRS is not practical, the ascending sort order of the sub-zone identifiers can be specified as a fallback,
based on either the ASCII character strings of the textual identifiers, or the 64-bit integer identifiers.

IMPORTANT: When defining sub-zone order based on a space-filling curve, the curve must go through every sub-zone of the parent zone (all zones at least partially within the parent zone), and if the curve goes
through zones fully outside of the parent zone, those outside zones must be excluded from this local indexing order, as they are not considered sub-zones.

[[isea9r-dggrs]]
=== ISEA9R DGGRS definition

The following DGGRS is for an axis-aligned and equal-area DGGH based on the https://doi.org/10.3138/27H7-8K88-4882-1752[Icosahedral Snyder Equal-Area (ISEA)] planar projection (see https://proj.org/en/9.4/operations/projections/isea.html[PROJ] and https://github.com/mocnik-science/geogrid/blob/master/src/main/java/org/giscience/utils/geogrid/projections/ISEAProjection.java[geogrid] for open-source implementations) using rhombuses with a refinement ratio of 9.
When the ISEA projection is rotated clockwise 60 degrees, sheared horizontally by a -60 degrees angle, and units are mapped to a 5x6 space, the zones become square and their edges are aligned with the CRS axes, while remaining equal area.
A https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html[2D Tile Matrix Set] can also be defined in this transformed CRS, allowing for compatibility with https://docs.ogc.org/is/20-057/20-057.html[OGC API - Tiles], https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=35326[WMTS] and traditional client and visualization software with no built-in DGGS functionality.
This transformed CRS distorts angles and distances more than the planar ISEA projection, but the topology, indexing, and surface geometry on the Earth model remains the same as in that planar ISEA projection.

While the ISEA projection is defined for an authalic sphere, this DGGRS assumes that when importing or exporting data referenced to the WGS84 ellipsoid a conversion between geodetic and authalic latitude is performed.
This guarantees that all zones are exactly the same area on the surface of the ellipsoid.

NOTE: The authalic (meaning "area preserving") sphere is a sphere that has the same surface area as the oblate ellipsoid being used.

[[ivea9r-dggrs]]
=== IVEA9R DGGRS definition

The IVEA9R DGGRS is very similar to the ISEA9R DGGRS described above, but using the Icosahedral Vertex-oriented Equal-Area (IVEA) projection (<<vanLeuuwen2006>>) instead of ISEA.
Rather than mapping to straight lines great circles originating from the center of the icosahedron vertices, IVEA uses great circles originating from the icosahedron vertices.
In terms of how each of the 120 spherical triangles of the disdyakis triacontahedron, which constitute the full spherical icosahedral symmetry, are mapped to flat triangles,
this is actually equivalent to applying Snyder's projection to the dodecahedron as illustrated in Figure 11 of Snyder's 1992 paper <<Snyder1992>> (which could be called "DSEA"),
when considering the barycentric coordinates within the corresponding 120 projected triangles, but re-mapping them through an affine transformation to the net of the icosahedron.
The IVEA projection avoids the perceptible cusps, or sharp changes in direction, of ISEA and therefore yields more regular shapes for zones which in turn should result in
generally improved measures of the Goodchild criteria.

=== ISEA3H DGGRS definition

The following DGGRS is for an ISEA3H DGGH, also based on the ISEA planar projection, with hexagonal and pentagonal zones, and a refinement ratio of 3, using a zone reference system based in part on its dual relationship with the ISEA9R DGGH.
The DGGH is considered equal area, although each of the 12 pentagonal zones at any level occupies 5/6th of the area of a hexagonal zone at the same level.

image::images/ISEA3H-Level2.png[width=700,align="center"]

The sub-zone ordering for this DGGRS is based on scanlines of tightly packed hexagons, sharing whole edges
with the previous and next zone within a scanline, while each zone shares two edges with the
previous scanline, and another two edges with the next scanline. The scanlines start on a vertex of the parent zone
for an even relative depth, while they start on an edge for an odd relative depth.

=== ISEA7H DGGRS definition

The ISEA7H DGGRS is also based on the ISEA projection, and uses the same icosahedron orientation as the other DGGRSs described above, but with a refinement ratio of 7.

An alternate ISEA7H DGGRS for the same Discrete Global Grid Hierarchy (DGGH) could be defined using another indexing such as Z7 (<<<Sahr2019>>>), as described for IGEO7 (<<<kmoch2025>>>).
The DGGH would be considered the same, with identical topology and zone geometry, as long as the same ISEA projection, orientation and the WGS84 ellipsoid
(i.e., converting geodetic latitude to authalic latitude prior to applying the ISEA projection) are used.

=== IVEA7H DGGRS definition

The IVEA7H DGGRS is very similar to the ISEA7H DGGRS described above, but using the IVEA projection (<<vanLeuuwen2006>>) instead of ISEA.
As for ISEA7H, alternate indexing schemes such as Z7 (<<<Sahr2019>>>) could be used to define an alternate DGGRS for the same DGGH whose topology and zone geometry are identical,
thus only requiring a mapping of zone identifiers to achieve interoperability.

[[rHEALPix-dggrs]]
=== rHEALPix DGGRS definition

The following DGGRS is for an axis-aligned and equal-area DGGH based on the rHEALPix projection (<<Gibb2016>>).
The shape of zones in this projection are squares with a refinement ratio of 9, starting with six squares covering the globe at level 0.
The rHEALPix projection re-arranges the four triangles of each polar caps of the HEALPix projection so that each pole forms a square the same size as 1/4th of the equatorial band,
resulting in the net of a cube with 6 equal area-faces.
The HEALPix projection itself is a combination of a Lambert cylindrical equal-area projection for the equatorial band between ±~41.93785° geodetic latitude (arcsin(2.0/3.0) authalic latitude),
with an interrupted Collignon projection for the polar caps.
In this definition of a rHEALPix DGGRS, an ellipsoid model of the Earth is used (which can be achieved by converting geodetic latitude to authalic latitude prior to the forward projection),
and the prime meridian is set to 50° East so as to avoid corners of the cube falling on land.
The square shape of zones in the rHEALPix projection maps to a variety of shapes on the surface of the Earth ranging from circles at the poles, to triangles, parallelograms, rectangles and squares.
The indexing used is hierarchical starting at level 0 with the letters N and S for the North and South polar zones, while letters O, P, Q, R are used for the equatorial band.
Further refined levels add one digit from 0 to 8 in row-major order from top-to-bottom and left-to-right.
The sub-zone order used for this DGGRS definition of rHEALPix is not hierarchical, but uses row-major, top-to-bottom, left-to-right scanlines throughout the entire parent zone.

=== GNOSIS Global Grid DGGRS definition

The following DGGRS is based on the https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html#toc58[variable width 2D Tile Matrix Set of the same name].
The GNOSIS Global Grid is axis-aligned, with the axes being the geographic latitude and longitude, and already corresponds to a registered 2DTMS.
Through the https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html#variable-matrixwidth-tile-matrix[variable width capability] of the tile matrices, this DGGH approximates equal area.
For example, at any refinement level, only 4 zones touch each pole.
Since the error budget still exceeds the 1%, it cannot be considered equal area per the https://docs.ogc.org/as/20-040r3/20-040r3.html#toc28[OGC Topic 21 DGGS Equal Area Earth Reference System Package].
However, this divergence from the mean zone area is the same along a particular row of zones following latitude lines, and can easily be calculated and taken into consideration.
Since its native axes are latitude and longitude, no additional reprojection is required to import data to or export data from this DGGH.
