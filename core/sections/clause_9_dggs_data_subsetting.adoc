== Requirements Class "Data Subsetting"

=== Overview

The OGC API - DGGS "Data Subsetting" requirements class extends the zone data retrieval requirements with the ability
to subset data for additional dimensions beyond those defined by the discrete global grid reference systems (DGGRS),
for example along time or vertical dimension if those axes are not part the DGGRS definition, or along additional dimensions
such as atmospheric pressure levels. Two query parameters are defined for this purpose: `datetime` (specifically for time) and
`subset` (for any dimension, including time). Additionally, this requirements class defines the `properties` query parameter
to select specific fields to include in the response instead of all fields which are included by defaults.
