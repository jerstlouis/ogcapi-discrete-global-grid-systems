[requirement]

[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/data-dggs-jsonfg/content
description:: For encoding zone data as DGGS-JSON-FG
part:: The Implementation SHALL support zone data requests negotiating an `application/geo+json` media type combined with a `profile` query parameter with a value of `jsonfg-dggs`, `jsonfg-dggs-plus`, `jsonfg-dggs-zoneids` or `jsonfg-dggs-zoneids-plus` allowing a client to request a DGGS-JSON-FG response.
part:: Every 200 response of the server for DGGS-JSON-FG zone data requests SHALL be an extended https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-045r1.html[Features & Geometry JSON] (JSON-FG) document representing the vector features within the requested zone.
part:: The JSON document SHALL follow the JSON Schema for JSON-FG, with geometry stored in a `dggsPlace` property mirroring the JSON-FG `place` schema and supporting all of the same feature types, but where `coordinates` use sub-zone indices (for `profile=jsonfg-dggs` or `jsonfg-dggs-plus`) or global textual zone identifiers (for `profile=jsonfg-dggs-zoneids` or `jsonfg-dggs-zoneids-plus`) as described in later parts of this requirement.
part:: For `profile=jsonfg-dggs-plus` and `jsonfg-dggs-zoneids-plus`, the JSON document SHALL also include geometry stored in `geometry` or `place` using traditional coordinate reference system coordinates for compatibility.
part:: The JSON document SHALL additionally contain a `dggrs` property set to the URI or CURIEs of the DGGRS of the response, which replaces the `coordRefSys` property and concept.
part:: The JSON document SHALL additionally contain a `zoneId` property indicating the requested reference zone.
part:: The JSON document SHALL additionally contain a `depth` property corresponding to the relative zone depth (as specified in the single depth format of the OGC API - DGGS `zone-depth` query parameter for zone data retrieval), determining how coordinates are resolved from sub-zone indices (in the case of `profile=jsonfg-dggs` and `jsonfg-dggs-plus`), and as a result, their precision.
part:: For `profile=jsonfg-dggs` and `jsonfg-dggs-plus`, the JSON document SHALL contain a `dggsPlace` property specifying geometry using local sub-zone indices ranging from 1 to the number of sub-zones within the reference parent zone at the declared depth, based on the deterministic sub-zone order of the DGGRS.
part:: For `profile=jsonfg-dggs-zoneids` and `jsonfg-dggs-zoneids-plus`, the JSON document SHALL contain a `dggsPlace` property specifying geometry using global textual zone identifiers (as defined in the DGGRS zone indexing reference system) at the declared depth.
part:: When all spatial coordinates are dimensions of the DGGRS, the array of coordinates including the square brackets SHALL be replaced by the local index or global identifier of the sub-zone within which the coordinates are located.
part:: When additional spatial coordinates that are not part of the DGGRS, such as elevation above ground for a 2D DGGRS, are needed to define the geometry coordinates,
only the coordinates corresponding to DGGRS dimensions SHALL be replaced by the local index or global identifier of the sub-zone.
part:: Only features fully or partly located within the reference zone SHALL be included.
part:: For feature geometry intersecting the boundaries of the reference zone, the sub-zone within which the intersection is located SHALL be included,
with a separate single `0` special sub-zone index (in the case of `profile=jsonfg-dggs` and `jsonfg-dggs-plus`) or a `null` value (in the case of `profile=jsonfg-dggs-zoneids` and `jsonfg-dggs-zoneids-plus`)
representing all outside points before a point inside, after a point inside, or in between two inside points.
part:: For geometry in two or more dimensions with an outside point (identified by a `0` sub-zone index for `profile=jsonfg-dggs` and `jsonfg-dggs-plus`, or `null` for `profile=jsonfg-dggs-zoneids` and `jsonfg-dggs-zoneids-plus`)
and which is necessarily between two contour points, the portion of the zone edge(s) between the exit and entry point SHALL be considered inside of that contour.
part:: The URI of the selected or default DGGS-JSON-FG profile SHALL be included in the `links` section of the JSON-FG response.

[recommendation]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /rec/data-dggs-jsonfg/profile-links
part:: The implementation SHOULD return a link to the default or selected profile as a `Link` HTTP response header, for example `Link: https://www.opengis.net/def/profile/ogc/0/jsonfg-dggs; rel="profile"`.
====

[recommendation]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /rec/data-dggs-jsonfg/geometry
part:: The implementation SHOULD support a `geometry` query parameter allowing a client to choose how to return feature geometry.
part:: The implementation SHOULD support a value of `geometry=zone-centroid` to request a representation where each feature is a zone intersecting the data, with the geometry of each feature being a Point geometry for the centroid of that zone.
part:: The implementation SHOULD support a value of `geometry=vectorized` to request a representation where each feature corresponds to a feature of the data (sharing identical property values).
part:: If a `geometry` value is not specified, the Implementation SHOULD return the representation closest to the native data.
part:: If a requested geometry representation is not supported, the Implementation SHOULD return a 4xx HTTP error.
====

[permission]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /per/data-dggs-jsonfg/supported-profiles
part:: An Implementation MAY support only a subset of the defined DGGS-JSON-FG profiles.
part:: An Implementation MAY return any profile as the default when the `profile` query parameter is not specified in the request. As an example, this allows for static servers to return only a DGGS-JSON-FG representation.
