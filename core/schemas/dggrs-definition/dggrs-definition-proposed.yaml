   Discrete Global Grid System Reference System (DGGRS) Definition.
   This provisional schema is provided as informative guidance until a normative OGC Topic 21 - Part 5: DGGRS Definition Schema is finalized.
   DGGRS descriptions for OGC API - DGGS must link to such a definition using the link relation type http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/dggrs-definition.
   A JSON DGGRS definition is intended to provide a complete and unambiguous definition of a DGGRS, including the topology of the grids hierarchy,
   the mapping to a particular underlying Earth model, the zone identifier reference system and the deterministic sub-zone order, allowing to implement the
   OGC API - DGGS functionality for that DGGRS in interoperable clients and servers.
   At least until a normative schema is published as a Topic 21 part, clients should rely on matching URIs associated with specific DGGRS definitions
   they recognize rather than attempt to parse the definition's content.
   This is intentionally included in the OGC API - DGGS example OpenAPI definition for reference, but unused in resource paths, since the API is only
   required to provide a link, but not necessarily host the definition itself at any partiular resource path.

              The zones are ordered in tightly packed scanlines.
              For an odd relative depth, scanlines start along a hexagon edge, whereas for even relative depths, scanlines start on a hexagon vertex.
              Scanlines run in a clockwise direction.
              For sub-zones at an even refinement level, zones are ordered left to right along a scanline and scanlines are ordered from top to bottom
              (considering the ISEA planar projection).
              For sub-zones at an odd refinement level, zones are ordered top to bottom along a scanline and scanlines are ordered from left to right.
              Sub-zones are at an even refinement level when the parity (even/odd) of the parent zone level corresponds to the parity of the relative depth, and
              at an odd refinement level when the parity of the parent zone level and relative depth do not match.
              For polar pentagons, the orientation of the scanlines varies in the ISEA planar projection but is always clockwise,
              the vertex/edge of the first sub-zone is on the left side of the planar ISEA projection for the north pole (in root rhombus 0),
              and on the right side for the south pole (in root rhombus 9).
