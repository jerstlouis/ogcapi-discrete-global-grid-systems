   "description": "A Discrete Global Grid Reference System based on the GNOSIS Global Grid 2D Tile Matrix Set, a {hexLevel}-{hexRow}-{hexCol} indexing system, and scanline-based sub-zone ordering. Making use of variable matrix widths, zones are divided by 4, unless they touch the pole, in which case the half touching the pole is not split longitude-wise. The error budget is ~-25.8/+66.0% from mean zone size (+/- 45.9% from median) up to level 25 (~849 cmÂ² mean zones).",
