  defaultDepth:
    description: >-
      The default zone depth returned for zone data retrieval when the `zone-depth` parameter is not used.
      This is the DGGS resolution levels beyond the requested DGGS zone’s hierarchy level included in the
      response, when retrieving data for a particular zone. This can be either:
      • A single positive integer value — representing a specific zone depth to return e.g., `5`;
      • A range of positive integer values in the form “{low}-{high}” — representing a
        continuous range of zone depths to return e.g., `1-8`; or,
      • A comma separated list of at least two (2) positive integer values — representing a
        set of specific zone depths to return e.g., `1,3,7`.
        A particular data encoding imply a particular zone depth and not support the default zone depth specified here,
        in which case the default zone depth (or the only possible depth) for that encoding will be used.

    description: Links to related resources. A `self` link to the Discrete Global Grid Reference System description and an `[ogc-rel:dggrs-definition]` link to the DGGRS definition (using the schema defined by https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-discrete-global-grid-systems/blob/master/core/schemas/dggrs-definition/dggrs-definition-proposed.yaml) are required. An `[ogc-rel:dggrs-zone-query]` link to query DGGS zones should also be included if _DGGS Zone Query_ is supported.
